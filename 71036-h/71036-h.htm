</div>


<p>It was a severely cold morning in
January, which succeeded a heavy fall
of snow through the night, five winters
ago, that I remarked from my parlour
window, a child lingering round the
gateway; he was apparently ten or
eleven years of age, and miserably clad
in tattered garments, that seemed ill
calculated to exclude the cold.</p>

<p>I beckoned him from the window to
come in, but the moment he perceived
me he shrunk aside, and directly ran
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4_62]</span></p>

<p>The circumstance soon passed from
my mind, and I thought no more of the
boy till the following day, when I saw
him again by the gate.</p>

<p>I directly sent a domestic to bring
him into the kitchen, but before he
could effect his errand the child had
fled.</p>

<p>This conduct appeared unaccountable,
and the more so, when I learnt
from my man James, that he had seen
the same boy almost daily during the
fortnight past about the same hour.</p>

<p>I directed him to watch the succeeding
day, and by all means to detain him;
his appearance being altogether so
wretched and destitute, that I could not
feel easy till something was done for
its alleviation.</p>

<p>The third morning James succeeded
in stopping him, and with much difficulty
brought him into the house, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5_63]</span>
was leading him to the fire, when he
found that one of his feet was frozen,
and his hands quite chilled. Proper
restoratives were immediately applied,
which soon had a good effect; yet it
was long before the gentlest persuasions
could induce him to speak. We
gave him food, which he ate greedily,
and asked for more. After some hours,
when he had been left to sit quietly, he
appeared to gain confidence, or rather
to be restored to feeling. I asked his
name, to which he replied, “John Williams,
ma’am.”</p>

<p>“And where is your home?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got any.”</p>

<p>“Where did you last come from?”</p>

<p>“The glass-house.”</p>

<p>“But you could not live there.”</p>

<p>“No, I only hid myself when I could,
behind the boxes, and warmed me when
the men were not about the furnaces.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6_64]</span></p>

<p>“And where did you get your food?”</p>

<p>“I went without when I could not
beg any thing to eat.”</p>

<p>“Have you any parents?”</p>

<p>“No, they both died in the Almshouse,
and I was put there with them
for a time, but I got away.”</p>

<p>“And why did you run away? you
were clothed, warmed, and fed there, as
well as properly employed, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“I did not like it though: I did not
like to learn: I did not like any body
there. Before mother died she used to
scold and beat me; and after that I did
not care to mind any body; I don’t
want to work there.”</p>

<p>“And will you work any where if
you can get employment?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I want to go off in
a ship.”</p>

<p>“But you are too young now, and you
should first learn something; are you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7_65]</span>
not willing to learn reading and writing?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I should like it if that
would help me to go to sea.”</p>

<p>“Have you no relations now your
parents are dead, who can help to take
care of you till you are older?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know any: I don’t want to
be put under any body’s care: I want
to do as I please, and have enough to
eat.”</p>

<p>“That you cannot expect while you
choose to run about the streets in this
way;—where have you slept these few
nights past?”</p>

<p>“In your wood-house, on an old blanket
which covers a box; I crept under
the things and tried to keep warm, for
I did not dare to go any more to the
glass-house, for the man threatened to
beat me if he saw me about there again.”</p>

<p>I found from the few facts thus related<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8_66]</span>
by poor John, that he was much to be
pitied for the forlorn state into which
he was cast, and for his utter ignorance,
and determined to ride over and
inquire of the overseer of the Almshouse,
something more particular concerning
him. His appearance was that
of a child who had been exposed to
evil company and bad example; and I
hoped as he was so very young, something
might be done to eradicate the
seeds of wickedness thus early sown in
his heart, and in their place cultivate
virtuous and religious principles.</p>

<p>I therefore hastened to leave home,
giving directions that he should be detained
till my return.</p>

<p>I was not long in reaching that place
which has witnessed so much misery,
but where so great good has also been
done, the Almshouse in Leveret street,
(since pulled down). Mr. P*****, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9_67]</span>
overseer gave me all the information I
sought, briefly, in the following words;</p>

<p>“The boy of whom you inquire, has
run away, and been returned to us a
great many times, and has been the
cause of much trouble here. His parents
were once what the world calls
likely people; I knew them when they
were both well off, and industrious; but
they lived without either the fear or the
love of God before their eyes, and so
they fell into temptation, and from that
into vice.</p>

<p>“It is about two years ago, that John
Williams, the father of this poor miserable
child, left his occupation on a
wood wharf, and engaged in a distillery,
one of those manufactories of slow poison
for thousands of wretches who eagerly
buy, drink, and perish, after laying
the foundation, and too often effecting
the ruin of their families.—John<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10_68]</span>
Williams, as I say, engaged in a distillery,
where the custom of tasting a little,
and then a little more, gradually grew
into a longing desire to taste much and
often. In a few months he rendered
himself, as others had done before him,
useless to his employer, and worse than
useless to his family. He was turned
away and gave himself wholly up to
idleness and drink. He neglected to
provide for his wife and child, and at
home did nothing but quarrel, and vent
the ill humour he acquired abroad; and
miserable to relate, in less than a year
his wife became as useless and sinful as
he. Their once quiet home was now
the scene of perpetual strife and discord;
mutual dislike succeeded to mutual
reproach, and the unfortunate little
John had the example of both parents
to initiate him in those early lessons of
vice;—and deeply have the seeds of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11_69]</span>
corruption been sown in his young
heart. These beings had never studied
their Bible; they had never sought
that holiness, which fortifies against
vice; they had first lived merely moral
lives, and when the hour of temptation
came, they possessed not that grace
which alone can withstand its allurements
or retreat from its wiles. Alas!
they did not reflect that God is angry
with the wicked every day; that they
who sow in wickedness shall reap the
same.</p>

<p>“One by one, this wretched family disposed
of the articles of their household
comforts for the miserable pittance of
a dram. When all was gone, nothing
remained for them but beggary, and
the child was sent abroad to solicit
charity, and beaten if he came back
empty handed. The want of success,
which sometimes attended his excursions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12_70]</span>
and the fear of punishment at
home, drove him to theft;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> in fine, matters
came to such a pass, that they were
all sent here for reformation, but that
was not so easily to be effected.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> A fact—and we fear one of not rare occurrence.</p>

</div>

<p>“They were lost to every feeling of
shame, and religion had never influenced
them. John had ruined his naturally
strong and healthy constitution
by his intemperance, and was fast sinking
into the grave; his lost situation had
no effect on his wife, except to increase
her ill feelings. John died about three
months since, and his wife four weeks
after him, having cut short their lives
by their sins, which, if properly spent,
might have witnessed them in the enjoyment
of a virtuous old age, blessed,
perhaps, by the pious and filial cares of
their only son. But now all is past, and
the end of their doings has returned
upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13_71]</span></p>

<p>“And this child who has been wandering
round the streets, has he any
good dispositions by which one might
hope to make an honest man of him?”</p>

<p>“Not any that I could ever find out;
the works of his hands were here evil
continually; he was doing mischief unless
closely watched from morning till
night, and no punishment made him
better; if you choose to take him off
our hands we shall be glad to give him
up to you, for here I do not see that
there is any hope of amending him; he
is young to be sure, only ten years old
now, so perhaps he can be made something
of; and if he can, why society
may one day have an honest member
more than I now fear it will.”</p>

<p>After a little consideration, I made
up my mind, that unless some effectual
means were immediately adopted, this
poor orphan boy might come to a disgraceful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14_72]</span>
death, and that it was my duty
to do all that could be done to avert
such an evil. Accordingly I gave my
obligation to take the direction of him
for one year, thinking that less time
would not be giving him a fair trial,
nor should we be likely to witness a
change, unless it was wrought within
that period.</p>

<p>On my return home, I found he had
been silent, and quiet in one place,
watching with curiosity the various
employments of the domestics. I asked
him if he would like to live in my
family and learn to help James.</p>

<p>He did not answer for some time,
and then he said he did not like to
work. I asked him if he had ever
tried to do any thing. Not much, he
replied, they made me do a little at the
Almshouse, but my task was more
than the other boys, and so I would not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15_73]</span>
do any thing if I could help it, and ran
away whenever I could get a chance.</p>

<p>“But are you not willing, if I give you
clothes, and food, and a comfortable
bed to sleep on, to bring the bark and
wood to make my fire of in the parlour,
and sometimes go of errands for
me?”</p>

<p>“I will, perhaps, if you do not beat
me for every thing.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will behave well, and
then you will not need punishment.
You can do nothing till your frozen
foot is healed; so I wish you to observe
all that James does, and see if
there is nothing you can do for him
when you are well.”</p>

<p>With this proposal John seemed satisfied,
and I left him to make some
purchases for his more comfortable
clothing.</p>

<p>I felt that great care was necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16_74]</span>
in order to reclaim him, and resolved
to proceed with caution.</p>

<p>In a week he could walk about, and
appeared favourably impressed with the
kind treatment which he constantly received.
He attached himself to James,
who was a religious, orderly man, and
helped him whenever he could find
opportunity for so doing.</p>

<p>It was not long before he found a
pleasure in work, and executed my little
errands faithfully. I gave him short
lessons daily, in the form of advice and
counsel, and was happy to find him
become attracted by the Bible lessons,
which James read after the day’s work
was ended. At prayers, too, he had
learnt to fix his mind on what was
passing, and it seemed he took great
pleasure when the morning hymn was
sung.</p>

<p>It was now time that he should learn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17_75]</span>
to read, and I thought a school would
be the best place for him. There lived
in our neighbourhood a worthy man
who kept several boys of this class, a
few hours daily; and as I knew John
had as yet no fondness himself for
books, I did not wish to disgust him
entirely, by sending him all day to the
public school.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown, the master, heard John’s
story with interest, and promised to exert
his influence in teaching him whatever
might be most important for him
to learn.</p>

<p>When John heard that he was to go
to school, he did not appear much
pleased; he had been willing to work
about the house, but the idea of books
and a school, had the appearance of
toil to him. At last his gratitude towards
me prevailed; he was conscious
that I had already done much for his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18_76]</span>
good, and would not send him to a master,
if it were not for his advantage.</p>

<p>He still wished to go to sea; and I
had promised him that if he learnt well
and was a good boy, he should go in
two or three years.</p>

<p>I was pleased to see that his early
habits of theft and wickedness were
gradually yielding to the influence of
steady kindness and discipline. It was
at this period that I thought direct religious
instruction could be given with
success. That a child of his age should
suddenly reform, could not be expected
in the course of things; but the great
mercy of God could now impress him,
and he began to pray himself, in language
which I had taught him. First
shame and then gratitude operated to
subdue his sinful habits; and this state
of mind, I felt, would be followed by
better and higher motives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19_77]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Brown sent me word when John
had been with him three months, that
he was learning very fast, and that he
had never caught him in an untruth; he
also said that his honesty was genuine
and sincere, as the following anecdote
will prove.—Mr. Brown lost, as he
thought, somewhere in, or about the
school-room, a dollar bill. The boys
looked for it a long time without finding
it, and the search was given up as
fruitless. After many days John, who
knew well the value of the money, had
the good fortune to find it, as he was
sweeping the room in his turn, among
some waste papers, which had been
thrown from his master’s desk. No
one was with him; and he looked at
the bill with a wish, as he afterwards
owned, to keep it, and tell no one that
it was found. He might have done
this with security, for the bill had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20_78]</span>
totally given up as lost, and would never
again have been inquired for. As he
stood with it in his hand, he all at once
remembered the commandment which
he that very week had learnt, and said
to me, “Thou shalt not steal;” and his
conscience told him it would be in one
sort stealing, if he kept what he had
found, when he knew to whom it had
belonged.</p>

<p>His master too, had read that very
morning from the scriptures, a lesson
which now came in aid of his better
feelings—“If we sin wilfully after that
we have knowledge, then is there no
more pardon for sins,”—“but a fearful
looking for of punishment.” He remembered
that he had been told that
God loved all who tried to subdue their
bad propensities, and become good
and honest. He knew that God was
angry with the wicked, and that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21_79]</span>
would not go to him, and be happy
when they died, if they did not repent.
He knew too, that God was pleased
when any sinful thoughts of the heart
were driven out.</p>

<p>Just then one of his school fellows
came back after a book. Moses Wild
was not a good boy, and when he saw
the money, and heard John say he
should carry it to Mr. Brown as soon
as he had done his work, he told him
he was a fool for his pains; that if the
bill was in his hands, he should keep
it, and buy nuts, and oranges, and cake
with it. But John’s mind was now
fixed; he positively said the money
should go to his master; and Moses,
finding that his evil counsel was unheeded,
walked off sneering at what he
called John’s religious scruples, and
disappointed that he had not been able
to get the victory and share the spoil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22_80]</span></p>

<p>Now it happened that Mr. Brown
had heard all that passed from an adjoining
room, where he was writing;
John very soon finished his task, and
then went to seek his master. He returned
the bill, and a gleam of joy thrilled
through his heart, when he was commended
for his good deeds and the
practice he had already made upon the
lessons of piety which were given him
at school, and those which he also received
at home. And happier yet was
he when he was told his mistress should
be informed of his trustworthy and
good behaviour.</p>

<p>That night John attended prayers
with more earnestness, and repeated
his own lesson with more seriousness,
than had been remarked for a long
time. He went on day by day making
himself more useful and active about
the house, and at school doing his
best to get forward in his learning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23_81]</span></p>

<p>He could now read fluently, and
spent all his leisure in reading those
good little books for children, of which
there are so many. He tried to imitate
James his fellow-servant, in all his
good habits, and at the end of two
years, one would never have recognised
the half starved and wicked Almshouse
Orphan.</p>

<p>John was twelve years old; he could
read, write, and cypher well, very well,
for the time he had been learning, and
though he felt attached to my family by
gratitude and affection, he still retained
a strong desire to go to sea. I told
him, as he one day respectfully reminded
me of my promise to let him go,
that a child like him could know little
of the hardships of a seafaring life, but
that I had heard of a good Captain,
under whose care I would put him to
serve as a cabin boy for six months, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24_82]</span>
at that time he should return to my
family if he found his way of life too
hard. The tears rolled down his
cheeks as he thanked me, and promised
to do as well as he could. I sent
for Captain Munson, who agreed to
take John, and desired that he might
be ready to sail for South America, in
a week.</p>

<p>He was young, he said, as he looked
at the boy, but stout, and appeared as
if he might perform a cabin boy’s duty.</p>

<p>John, when told he was to go in a
week, appeared to feel that it would be
more difficult to leave the family and
his fellow-servants than he had hitherto
thought it would be.</p>

<p>He made himself perpetually busy,
early and late; any little thing which
he could find to do for any one was
carefully performed. He discovered
some ingenuity in mending locks and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25_83]</span>
hinges, and other little things, which in
a house, are often getting out of order.
Every room was looked into; if perchance
a nail might be loosened, the
putty falling from a pane of glass or a
button off—in truth, there was nothing
of this sort which escaped his care.</p>

<p>The week soon passed away,—his
sea clothes were all made, and sent on
board the vessel. John went to take
leave of his faithful teacher, Mr.
Brown, who gave him several good
books and his blessing at parting.</p>

<p>He appeared to delay leaving us till
the last hour. It was a fine day, the
wind was fair, and all things prosperous,
when a summons came for him to
go on board. I will not attempt to
describe his parting; he had interested
every member of the household during
the time he had been among them, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26_84]</span>
now that he was going away, all felt
the interest increased.</p>

<p>I gave him his Bible after my last
advice, with the injunction to read it
daily, and to let nothing deter him from
the faithful performance of his religious
duties. He promised with tears that
he would do as I desired, and try never
to forget that great Being who had
mercifully reclaimed his soul from sin,
and early depravity.</p>

<p>He went from us with a heavier
heart than he had expected, but the
novelty of his situation soon engaged
him, and he was not suffered to remain
idle while all were busy around him.</p>

<p>Some months elapsed, and the vessel
which sailed with John was expected
daily into port. We were impatient
to learn how he had conducted himself,
and whether he had been happy
and serviceable to his master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27_85]</span></p>

<p>One morning, an unusual bustle in
the kitchen induced me to inquire the
cause personally, when who should I
find there, but our young sailor boy.
He seemed wholly beside himself with
joy, at seeing all his friends, and it was
long before he could give any account
of his voyage.</p>

<p>He had brought some gift for every
member of the family—giving to each
such things as were most likely to be
valued by them. His Captain had been
kind to him, and his love of a seaman’s
life was nothing lessened. He was
glad to get back, glad to see all who
had ever befriended him, but he
thought he should still keep with Captain
Munson. He delighted to talk of
the past; to ask a thousand questions
concerning the progress of things during
his absence, and appeared rejoiced
that all was well. He did not forget<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28_86]</span>
his schoolmaster, but carried him an
offering the first day of his arrival.</p>

<p>Captain Munson himself called, in a
few days, to tell me personally how
John had deported himself, and it was
with true pleasure I learnt that the
habits of devotion which had been
taught him on land, were not forgotten
or neglected at sea.</p>

<p>“His conduct, was,” said the Captain,
“always worthy of praise; we had two
new hands when we put out of port,
who had lived disorderly lives in other
vessels, and who scrupled not to swear,
and abuse their messmates, who had
sailed with me a long time, and had
been brought to sober thought. These
two sailors liked especially to vex and
teaze John, or as they called him,
“pious Jack.” Their taunts produced
no other effect on the boy, except to
make him more serious and forbearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29_87]</span></p>

<p>“After a time, they became ashamed
of their folly in attempting to provoke
one who always returned them good
for evil, and who was ready at all hours
to oblige them. These men became
affected, rough as they were, by the
influence of this young cabin boy. He
persuaded them, after a time, to hear
him read some tracts as they sat unemployed,
as they often were for some
hours together. They were particularly
interested in the story of “George
Gordon,” and ever after hearing that,
listened to John when he offered to read.
He carried them his Bible, and they confessed
they could not read themselves.
He said he would teach them, and I
assure you, Madam,” continued the Captain,
“I never saw more patience exemplified
than in this humble work of love,
and christian charity.</p>

<p>“The sailors were soon in a fair way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30_88]</span>
to profit from his lessons, and began to
study the scriptures for themselves. I
gave each of them a Testament, and
now, instead of wasting their time in
idle conversation, they filled up every
spare moment with study and usefulness.
In them the text of scripture
was reversed;—‘Good communication
had reformed their manners,’—and
they became the most valuable hands
on board.</p>

<p>“While off the coast we encountered
a heavy gale, and then John’s religion
was put to the most certain test: for
some hours we expected the ship would
go to pieces; the night was dark and
terrific; we were in danger of being
driven on the shoals, and losing life
with the cargo.</p>

<p>“We all knew that a moment might
end our lives. John was fearless; he
ran whichever way he was called, now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31_89]</span>
up the shrouds, then to the pumps below;
in fine, he laboured silently and
incessantly, and as soon as the tempest
had passed, he was the first to fall on
his knees and offer up thanks for the
preservation of our lives. I believe he
sincerely felt that the care of God was
over all who served him with sincere
purposes, and that he listened to the
prayer of the humble and contrite.</p>

<p>“No day passed without some expression
of thankfulness to you, who had
done so much for him, and I think his
constant petitions were for your happiness.
He said, that though God was
high, yet he had respect to the lowly;
that he was a God who heard and
accepted prayers, and he would bless
and reward his benefactress, and listen
even to him, a poor little cabin boy.”</p>

<p>I willingly consented now to relinquish
John, as it was his wish to continue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32_90]</span>
a sailor. The vessel was soon
fit for a second voyage, and he bade us
again farewell. Months passed on, and
the ship was not heard from; we began
to fear that she was lost, and these
fears were realized by accounts of destructive
tempests in that part of the
ocean where Captain Munson had
been sailing, and from whence several
vessels had arrived much injured.</p>

<p>We could hardly suppress our grief
when this sad news arrived, but reflection
convinced us, that if it were the
will of God thus to take the orphan
boy from the world, we had no right to
doubt its justice, or its mercy.</p>

<p>We knew that John was prepared to
die, and we could not feel regret that
he had been indulged in pursuing that
course of life for which he had such a
decided preference. We rejoiced that
the lessons of piety which it had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33_91]</span>
our happiness to impart, had taken
root and produced the fruits of righteousness.</p>

<p>We believed that he was removed,
perhaps in great mercy, from the evil
to come, and that he was now entered
upon a state of existence where the
good receive their reward; and that,
having here learnt the fear of the Lord,
it was now well with him.</p>

<p>You, who read this story, if you are
wicked, go now, and delay not that
reformation which alone will insure
your forgiveness of that great and good
Being, from whom you have received
the gift of life with many blessings.
Pray earnestly that grace may be given
you to resist temptation; pray for holiness,
and not only pray, but practise
that course of life which will alone aid
your endeavours, and be likely to merit
that your prayers be answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34_92]</span></p>

<p>“The humble, fervent prayer of the
righteous availeth much.”—“Ask, and
ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall
find; knock, and it shall be opened
unto you; for every one that asketh in
sincerity, receiveth; and he that seeketh
faithfully, findeth; and to him who
knocketh patiently, shall the door be
opened.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
